## 🎯 SUMMARY: WHAT TO DO

### ✅ DO THIS:
1. Use "pursuing FedRAMP authorization"
2. List specific implemented controls
3. Use "aligned with" or "built to" federal standards
4. Include disclaimer about authorization status
5. Emphasize your actual security capabilities
6. Use "FedRAMP Ready" after 3PAO engagement

### ❌ DON'T DO THIS:
1. Claim to be "FedRAMP Authorized" without ATO
2. Use FedRAMP logo or seal
3. Imply you have authorization you don't have
4. Make definitive compliance claims
5. Overstate your current status

### 🎯 BEST APPROACH:
**Be honest, be specific, be impressive:**

"FusionEMS Quantum implements 400+ security controls aligned with 
FedRAMP High Impact requirements. We are actively pursuing FedRAMP 
authorization with an assessment-ready compliance package. Our 
platform exceeds industry security standards and is designed for 
organizations requiring the highest levels of security and compliance."
