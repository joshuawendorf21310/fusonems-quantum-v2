# Fix database engine hardening and pooling configuration

This pull request is no longer WIP and is ready for review and merge.

Fix 3 is complete and fully aligned with the platform hardening plan.

Summary confirmation:
	•	Database engine creation is centralized and authoritative.
	•	All runtime access uses the canonical engine.
	•	Connection pooling is configurable via environment variables with safe defaults.
	•	No schema changes and no data migration required.
	•	Backward compatible with existing deployments.
	•	Documentation and deployment defaults are included.

This PR closes Fix 3 (Database Engine Hardening) and unblocks the next phase:
Fix 4 — Authentication and Session Hardening.

Reviewer note:
This change is configuration- and safety-focused only. No business logic behavior has been altered.

Ready to merge.
